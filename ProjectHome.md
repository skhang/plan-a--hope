**Plan A** is a schedule manager which takes user requests and returns peer-created responses. When the provided responses are not adequate, the request is broadcast to likely peers.

**Hope** is a simplified consumer interface with minimal content creation tools. Premium versions of both apps are planned for fundraising purposes.

The program manages access to the smartphone's capabilities in order to allow end users to contribute complex responses.

The initial peer response environment is populated with open source hardware and software projects in order to promote them beside traditional sources.

A screensaver function offers additional links to open source projects in the context of an evolving science fiction storyline.

A fundamental question of evo psych is understanding how an individual decides upon a course of action. Either an apparently successful peer is imitated or the subject decides upon a new course of action. We are rewarding the publication of successful courses of action by maintaining a ranking system which decides which methods are broadcast to peers and also which are deleted.

The app performs a local application of Bayes Rule to a database of tagged peer created content in an effort to match domain specific user preference. User created filters are provided for, in order to override default rankings.
